# 🌟 Advanced Retrieval for AI with Chroma - Learning Notes

Welcome! 👋
This repo contains my **notebooks, notes, and experiments** from the course [**Advanced Retrieval for AI with Chroma**](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/advanced-retrieval-for-ai/) by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/).

The course dives into how to build smarter **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** systems using **ChromaDB** (an open-source embedding database). These notebooks are my way of practicing, tinkering, and learning by doing.

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sdivyanshu90/Advanced-Retrieval-for-AI-with-Chroma.git
   cd Advanced-Retrieval-for-AI-with-Chroma
   ```

2. Set up your environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Fire up Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 📚 Learning Goals

Through these exercises, I aim to:

* Understand how **ChromaDB** works behind the scenes.
* Practice **advanced retrieval techniques** (query transformation, reranking, filtering).
* Build my own **end-to-end RAG pipeline**.
* Document my journey so others can follow along (and maybe even improve on it!).
